All I know it's 10:35

Let ’em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thankin’, thankin' God you found me
That you found me

[Verse 1]
Every day, I go places in my head
Darker thoughts are harder now
They look like monsters under my bed
And every time, it's like a rocket through my chest
The TV make you think the whole world's about to end

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know where this night is goin' (Goin')
But I know that you and me got somethin' (Somethin’)
So many things that I’m afraid of (I'm afraid of)
But right now, I ain’t scared of nothin'
('Cause all I know it's, ’cause all I know it's, all I, all I)

'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me

So don't you worry about tomorrow
Don't you worry, just pass the bottle

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late
(Yeah, I can't keep chasing you
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch, you took me for granted
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect, I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in-depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now? Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate, but it's—

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough
You expect me to fold myself in half till I snap
Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still?
Man, I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this
So many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to
Shit, I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you, my life sentence is served, bitch
And it's just—
[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life

Well, I go to work every Monday
Get to do something I love
And I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
Got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
On the weekend it's full of good friends

[Chorus]
I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

[Verse 2]
I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
My dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years

[Chorus]
Now I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 2]
She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

Big Syke, 'Nook, Paint, Bogart, Big Serge (Yeah)
Vocês sabem como essa merda acontece (Vocês sabem)
Todos os olhos em mim
OG nessa porra
Bolando um no clube e tal, é isso mesmo?
Todos os olhos em mim
Todos os olhos em mim
Mas você quer saber?

[Verso 1: 2Pac]
Eu aposto que você entendeu errado, você não sabe em quem confiar
Tantos manos que odeiam, tentando soar como a gente
Dizem que estão prontos pro funk, mas eu não acho que eles sabem
Direto para as profundezas do Inferno, são pra onde os covardes vão
Bem, você ainda tá caído? Mano, olá quando você me ver
E que esses demônios se desculpem pelo dia em que finalmente me libertaram
Eu tenho uma Caravan para os manos toda vez que andamos
Acertando os filhos da puta quando passarmos
Até eu morrer, vivo a vida de um chefe, mesmo quando eu tô chapado
Mexa comigo e seja fuzilado depois, os futuros estão nos meus olhos
Porque tudo que eu quero é dinheiro e coisas assim
Um Benz cinco-duplo-0, exibindo os aros chamativos
Uhh, as vadias me perseguem igual um sonho
Sou conhecido por desaparecer diante dos seus olhos igual um viciado em drogas
Parece, meu principal objetivo era ser pago
O jogo tá mais afiado do que a porra de uma lâmina de barbear
Disse que o dinheiro traz vadias, as vadias trazem mentiras
Um mano tá ficando com inveja e os filhos da puta morrem
Dependem de mim igual o primeiro e o décimo terceiro
Eles podem me segurar por um segundo, mas esses punks não vão me pegar
Temos quatro manos em low riders e máscaras de esqui
Gritando, ""Vida Loka"" toda vez que eles passam, todos os olhos em mim

[Ponte: Big Syke]
Hey, pro meu mano 'Pac

[Verso 2: Big Syke]
Tanto problema no mundo, mano
Ninguém pode sentir sua dor
O mundo muda todo dia, o tempo tá passando rápido
Minha garota disse que eu preciso de um aumento, quanto tempo ela vai durar?
Eu tô preso entre a minha mulher, minha pistola e a minha grana
Mira tripla, tenho alguns baseados, assobio enquanto eu mergulho
Eu tô perdido na terra sem nenhum plano, vivendo uma vida perfeita
Chefe do crime, contrabando, deixa eu jogar isso
As prostitutas carentes têm muita coragem
Deixo meu balde desviar, eu tô saindo do meio-fio
A negligência do nervosismo me faz embalar uma TEC
Dedicado a servir esse Moët e pagar os cheques
Tipo o satélite Akai, mano, eu tô brilhando pra sempre
Isso não tá certo: parasitas, gatilhos e pulgas rastejando
Otário, se abaixe e seja pego, sem emoção
Minha devoção tá controlando o meu negócio mano, continuo navegando
Aonde você vai, eu estive lá, voltei tão solitário, mano
Firme fluindo contra a corrente, os manos ainda não me conhecem
É sobre o dinheiro nessa merda de rap, essa merda
Não é engraçado, os manos nem sabem como agir, merda
O que eu posso fazer? O que eu posso dizer? Existe outra maneira?
Baseados e gim o dia inteiro, 24 apostas
Meu pequeno G, você não vê que eu tô livre dos otários?
Os manos não me suportam; todos os olhos em mim
[Refrão: 2Pac]
Vivo a vida de um bandido até o dia que eu morrer
Vivo a vida de um chefe mesmo ficando chapado
Todos os olhos em mim
Todos os olhos em mim
Vivo a vida de um bandido até o dia que eu morrer
Vivo a vida de um chefe mesmo ficando chapado
Todos os olhos em mim

[Verso 3: 2Pac]
Os federais estão vigiando, os manos planejam me pegar
Eu vou sobreviver? Eu vou morrer? Venha, vamos imaginar a possibilidade
Me dando acusações, advogados tomando conta
Eu falei pro juiz que fui criado errado e é por isso que eu falava merda
Eu era hiperativo como uma criança, frio como um adolescente
No meu celular, ligando para os figurões da cena
Embalando centenas nas minhas gavetas, foda-se a lei
Vadias, eu transo com paixão, eu tô vivendo no seco e cru
Pegando casos em um ritmo rápido, brilhando na pista rápida
Trabalhando até de manhã, nunca parei até que o dinheiro viesse
Vivo a vida de um bandido até o dia que eu morrer
Vivo a vida de um chefe mesmo ficando chapado
Esses manos me fizeram jogar merda
Eu abaixei o teto, agora é hora de passar fio dental nas minhas coisas
Mantenha sua cabeça erguida, mano, faça esses filhos da puta sofrerem
Dentro de um Benz, queimando o pneu
O dinheiro é obrigatório, as putas são pro estresse
Esse estilo de vida criminoso, equipado com um colete à prova de balas
Certifique-se de que seus olhos estão no vale-refeição, ganhe o seu dinheiro
Filho da puta, vamos ficar ricos e vamos relaxar; todos os olhos em mim
[Refrão: 2Pac]
Vivo a vida de um bandido até o dia que eu morrer
Vivo a vida de um chefe mesmo ficando chapado
Todos os olhos em mim
Todos os olhos em mim
Vivo a vida de um bandido até o dia que eu morrer
Vivo a vida de um chefe mesmo ficando chapado
Todos os olhos em mim

[Outro: 2Pac]
Prestem atenção, meus manos! Viu como essa essa acontece?
O mano chegou nesse filho da puta e foi tipo: ""Bing!""
Policiais, vadias, todo corpo de um filho puta
(Vivo a vida de um bandido até o dia que eu morrer)

Everyone says I look happy

Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave

It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

I link T on my just rap, you can blow shit
Still think I'm Boston George on my blow shit
My boy's in a SVR, but he stole it
I flew past **** with my wap, told him hold it
Man keep talkin' my name, they keep trollin'
When they're more pussy than the pussyoles they roll with
Can't be pillow talkin' in these streets, I disown him (Yo)
Can't be talkin' about me, I kick doors in (Check)

[Verse 2: Tunde]
I link P on my jack jones in the morning
He was one up too 'cause we're staunch and they know this
My boys in a SRT, he didn't rent it
Took chase from the black bonnet and he bent it
I flew past the back of the еstate to go and pick him up
I sent Cappy round therе and told him, ""Go and lift him up""
'Cause man keep chattin' man name, they keep cappin' it
But one ****, so now I keep **** it

I've been buying watches and guns, that's insurance
Runnin' this for ten years runnin', that's endurance
I ain't worried bout nobody, they're all jokers
Like I ain't been steppin' with hammers and big boarers

I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air

And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

Beautiful,Eminem,Relapse: Refill,72,"289 ContributorsTranslationsفارسیBeautiful Lyrics[Intro: Paul Rodgers]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin' to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down then I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt
To vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat
On my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant actin' stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen
Stop sign pole at eight-years-old
I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't
Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably a 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a
Mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Aw, naw! Big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls (What?), dick six-inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby!
He's Shady! (He's so crazy!) (Ha-ha-ha)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like
And walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here:
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far

They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)

Of a runaway American dream
At night, we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were

[Verse 2]
Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels

About to drop the bomb I'm the motherfuckin' don
Big fish in a small pond
Now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything west of the Mississippi
Its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call

So quench yourself and drink the water that flows below her head

Oh no, there she goes
Out in the sunshine

I lost my head again, would you lie for me?

Close your eyes and bow your head, I need a little sympathy
'Cause fear is strong, and love's for everyone who isn't me
Kill your health and kill yourself and kill everything you love
And if you live, you can fall to pieces and suffer with my ghost

I lost my head again, would you lie for me?
I left her in the sand, just a burden in my hand

Don't need no one, she can dance on her own
Club is closin', but she ain't goin' home
Night is still young, where the hell will she go?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Ain't the first time 'cause I've seen her before
Smell her perfume as she walks through the door
I wanna know, where the hell will she go?
Nobody knows, nobody, nobody knows

No, you can't tame the girl
'Cause she runs her own world
So if she wanna party all night (All night)
No, you can't tame her, no
And you can't tie her down
When the night comes around
Said she gonna party all night (All night)
And you can't change her, can't blame her
Can't tame her

Who can catch lightning in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters?

Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em

There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin', no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin'
For no one, knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like, ""Woo!""
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly, he would too

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now

So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!

So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
(Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house)

Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

[Verse 1]
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been
In the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Spectacular over M-I-C
I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme, bite if you dare
I get the paper so I don't care
Fly that's me; the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I

Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
It's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun
If you don't understand then say you don't (nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best (say what?)
West to East, see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks, from New York to L.A
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Get out my shit, please let me be
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that
Trying to get over like a fat rat
But I understand I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop
It goes on, on, on, on
You see, the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere, that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you?
You better get down with your real crew
'Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die (Good job, Sho)
My father told me

[Chorus: SwitchOTR]
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members

You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members

You-you better hide, you better stay inside

[Verse 1: SwitchOTR]
See, I ain't really into the verbal
My broski strapped, no Dijk, no Virgil
The van might buss that circle
See, I'm tryna blow off this music ting
And pray that I end up commercial
And 'bout time that I make some records
Show them why that I go universal
('Cause I can't) 'Cause I can't get stuck in the ends
I need me a yard with a big ass fence
Lambo truck or Mercedes-Benz
No fake love, no need to pretend
If I cut you off, it's straight intent
Guys out here tryna drill and repent
Same bad B that I need in defence
The J1's coulda been A1, but I can't follow the latest trends
Broski might handle the can and let off shots, 'cause the bullets bisexual
It's really for them boy there, can definitely hit that bitch right next to you
Every time I rap on the beat, gotta show them why man feels presentable
And chicks love pick and choose their guys like a video game collectible

Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto

[Break 2: Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)

I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day

[Verse 1]
Hide and seek, I am somewhere closed away
You won't believe how long it's been since I started the game
I can't be seen and you won't find me today
I've not been this low, but I'll be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
""Are you alright?"" Maybe don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back
And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold

I sold bits, I sold raw
Press a brick, never fraud
Hit and miss, bet I score
Why he mad? He ain't sho'

[Chorus: Nafe Smallz]
I sold bits, I sold raw
I sold hits, sold out tours
Press a brick, never fraud
Said I'll quit, just sold some more
Hit and miss, bet I score
Fuck your bitch when I want
Why he mad? He ain't sho'
Different league, different dough
I sold bits, I sold raw
I sold hits, sold out tours
Press a brick, never fraud
Said I'll quit, just sold some more
Hit and miss, bet I score
Fuck your bitch when I want
Why he mad? He ain't sho'
Different league, different dough

[Verse 1: Nines]
I'm from the hood, now I live in a mansion
These niggas are mad, I'm counting these bags while I sit in a Phantom
Word to my jewellers, I spent quarter mill on my wrist and medallion
They said I'm ugly, and now I get money she thinks that I'm handsome
Touched down Dubai with the gang and we had a fun night
Went straight to the Louis V shop, from there we went Club White
Remember them days on the estate when we had to fight over nitties
Now it's tour dates and all these bitches ask me to sign on their titties
Won't see me in a club with no shank, fam, I always bring my strally
Before I went jail I was selling stardawg and bricks of ammi
When I had no packs I had to take a trip to Cali
I ain't even bring no suitcase, I just bought a list of addys
They ain't trapping like me, we ain't got the same quotes
If you ain't tryna buy a yacht next year, we ain't in the same boat
Niggas know I'm a plug, got bottom shelf and expensive weed
And I got mids, got bandos and dispensaries

[Verse 2: Clavish]
I just left mummy's house
The runners down on my feet, two and a Q
Respect from my niggas up in the trap
If it weren't for rap I'd be in there too
The feds, they hate me
They know I done some shavings bait but left no clue
Brought a hunting knife to war
Cah the three-eight never had no shoes
Told me she's leaving, why?
Cause I'm a rapper wasting her time
She hates when I'm up in DXB
Cause she knows what I do in Dubai
I end up giving them dick
I step in the club and never say ""Hi""
Then end up bussing my nut
And book her a cab, I never said ""Bye""
Course I got money, you can tell by the rip in my jeans
I'm at an awards show with my niggas daydreamin' bout hitting the fiends
I ride out sober, me and big homie pull up on the opps, drinking their lean
On road he was the baddest, went to jail now he on his deen
My niggas, they tell me to chill
Saying I spend too much on jackets
When it's time for guns I buy them, I think I spend too much on mashes
I buy waps but I'm into fashion, rather the Culli than the Phantom
I got a couple hoes from Glasgow
They just wanna fuck on me and the mandem
[Chorus: Nafe Smallz]

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts

But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker

And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what

I say I love you, but I don't
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable

[Verse 1]
I'm dead, but you probably can't tell
Been scalin' the walls of the wishin' well
My head's in the sky, but I'm fallin' backwards, yeah
Night crawlin', I'm wide awake in my dreams
Wake up and I don't know what anything means
We're completely different people than the people we wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
Have we outgrown this city? I'm so tired
Of wishin' I was somewhere different than where you are
With my eyes wide shut

[Chorus]
I say I love you, but I don't
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable
Oh, 'cause I don't get high off you anymore
No, I don't get high off you anymore

Smilin' into the mirror like a psychopath
Can't remember the last time you made me laugh
Drawing tears with my lipstick, you're the first on my hit list

And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, ""What's his is hers""

I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (falling into you)
Falling into you

Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
You must begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground

And it feels so good (falling into you)

Fast Car,Luke Combs,Gettin' Old,89,"5 ContributorsFast Car Lyrics[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising and entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Said I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

Well, I guess the third time's not a charm
Nursing a three times broken heart
I'm down the rabbit hole again
I put myself in another world
Where I can be any other girl
'Cause I don't really wanna face it

I fall in love with boys I see on a TV screen
The ones in books who are as perfect as they can be
I spend all of my time imagining what it would be like if they existed
My parents tell me I should look for one in real life
But I get let down by both the bad boys and the nice guys
I'm tired of giving more than I receive
So I'll just stick to the boys who don't know me

[Verse 2]
Oh, I hid his number, I almost called
Like, maybe he's hurting after all

Where they're meeting up halfway and they're kissing in the rain

Can't just let your guard down and fall for someone anymore
That's what stupid girls do
Yeah, I've been a stupid girl
Four days away, in his arms I invest
He won't take my heart, but he'll take off my dress
Excuses rehearsed, I am blue, I am red
Fuck lookin' for love
I'ma stay doin' what us bitches do best

[Chorus]
Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sippin' Hennessy
And tell him I'm dead if he callin' me
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch till you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy
Tell him I'm dead if he callin' me

[Verse 1]
You're a very silly man, block, block, mute chat
New addy in the sat, new dicks on tap
Got a best case, worst case, plan of attack
Got bitches, if they see you in the street, you're gettin' slapped
Don't threaten me or talk to me ever like that
I got brothers in the ends that'll pull up right now
You don't even wanna see the way I pull up right now
In my little black dress and my neck buss down how I (Hmm, hmm)

Block you off too swift
Hit a ting I used to link who always texts back fast
And I would tell you kiss my ass, I know you wish that you could
Since the fuckery from my past, I tend to move on quick, I tend to move on good
Seasoned the speed, now I'm over the man who was sleepin' underneath me
Said I couldn't live without you when I loved you
Well, I lied and you shouldn't have believed me
Twenty-four hours in the bed and believe me, it's 'bout to get freaky
Only get to see me when you see me on a phone screen, G
You no longer know me, I no longer want you, you may never hold me

You make love to me like I'm the one
Then run off and duck my calls for a month
Make me feel special and then like a mug
Got you up in my guts but I hate your guts""
I come back, darling, why you rantin'?
Girl, I'm single, and I always have been
Never promised you nothin' but panting
Sweating 'em plans on a late night antics

And you're only callin' me for the sex""

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness

And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?

I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it

Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew

Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch
[Chorus: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

And I don't know if I can love again
But I know for sure we can't be friends

So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before

Keep a mask, he got too many Ks

Can't go back, I got too many cases

Five hundred racks sittin' in my Urus
Ten carat diamonds spent in my earlobes

If I'm not the man, I'm the man in the middle
Hop out the car with my hand on my pistol

Fuck it, you know I still run with them guys
Drivebys a waste of my time, I want somebody to die

Yeah, yeah
""Once again, back is the incredible""

[Verse 1]
It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashin' hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizzazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up and play it loud
Hip-hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dance floors just stop, the spot's scorchin' hot
Hopin' I'll open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar, smokin' ten dollar cigars
While I admire MIDI, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catchin' diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin' track
Rockin' jams, by popular demand, I'm back

[Hook]
I control the crowd, you know Ra hold it down
When it drop, you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world-renowned
And I rock New York City all year around

It's on! So you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic, it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra's style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open, fill it with somethin' potent to go in
And take a toke then mental planes start floatin'
Hot science is smokin', altitudes cause chokin'
Product is hypnotic, you're soakin' and still smokin'
Showin' better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume's pumpin'
I'mma move crowds to two-thousand and somethin'

My rhymes and lyrics find spirits like a seance
Since fat crayons, I write and display chaos
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam is
I take advantage until the crowd go bananas
What a rush! I hear cuts and I lust to touch
Microphones be clutched by the illustrious
Word spread, I inherited many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time, no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find, you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be droppin' this
Some of the things that I know will be in your next bible
When I die, go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt, manifest, was writin' rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic

When it drop, you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound

Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)

And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there

And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

To really love a woman - Let her hold you

You know you really love a woman

Don't put your cover up

It was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw ya with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So I skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him five months (That's right)
Besides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years

I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want to violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still, he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs under moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparalleled
Into an ocean of love, we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control, but
It's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

Yeah
You know, I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah I do, haha

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I look at me now, I'm thinkin', ""Damn""
How proud of me I am
What I did is nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands
They're hollerin', ""Shady"" (""Shady"")
Yelling it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get the chance to get a crowd
I'd flip it around and have a crowd give me the chants
(I've done it all, man)
But in actuality, I haven't, yet

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem, Sly Pyper]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (My only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waiting room'll get
What I mean is maybe I have more patience (patients) than I'm able to admit
Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
Fame was a switch, but I was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch
That it would make me a raving lunatic
But I made it through my situation, I hit pay dirt
Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch
But just 'cause I made a little bit of change
Don't mean I've changed a little bit
Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
And I'm just berating you with it, it's Shady 'til I'm eighty-two
I'll spit this crazy, even Dre, he knows (nose) I'ma blow
Better get the handkerchief again, haha

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (Know I talk about this shit a lot, my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)

[Bridge: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Oh, now what am I gonna do?
Can't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose
Born a winner, damn, it's so hard to lose
I can do it even when I'm tryin' to
When my record flops, it still go through the roof
This atmosphere's for a chosen few
Who was on they grind makin' money moves
And you ain't gon' get there if you watered-down
You gotta take shots with a hundred proof (Check it out)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Been in survival mode
Since a five year old, it was I alone
Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
But lookin' back how bad it was then
If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
Addict mom and deadbeat dad
I wouldn't have had the savage within
Havin' to win every single battle I'm in
All I ever wanted was to be an emcee
Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
Learned to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
Would be as Eazy as E
And graffiti would be like remedial readin' to me (Yeah)
'Til my last breath leaves my lungs
I'ma beat my drum (Yeah) for the streets I'm from (Yeah)
The East side slums (Yeah), gotta remind 'em (Yeah)
I'll take a foe out (Yeah), like fee-fi-fum
You see my finger (What?), you see my thumb (What?)
You see my fist, fuck a peace pipe, I'm (What?)
Here for the smoke but it's not the weed I want (What?)
With this beat I brung for the beef I've come (Woo)
But you better bring it if you wanna reply from
'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
That'll be an uphill battle
But I'm up like your feet in a recliner
And I think I'm about to go out on a limb like a tree climber
Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause
[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (For the last time, my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey

C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
Like we the first ones to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick

Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me

Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim

Backin' down the ramp in my old truck
To find a bunch of logs
To catch a bunch of hogs
Yeah, I wrote the book
Yeah, I wrote the book

[Verse 2]
If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book

[Chorus]
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

[Verse 3]
I met a good girl she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up
[Chorus]
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
The one that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

[Bridge]
Yeah, the good Lord knows I need it
I didn't write it but I probably oughta read it

[Chorus]
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night

I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank 'til I was thirsty again
We went searchin' through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

I promised you I'd never give up

It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

And serve you French toast again

In the Ghetto,Elvis Presley,Elvis 30 #1 Hits,52,"30 ContributorsIn the Ghetto Lyrics[Verse 1]
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

[Bridge]
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way?

[Verse 2]
Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, he steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far

[Verse 3]
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Facedown on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And as her young man dies (In the ghetto)
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just died, so in
Case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine, so I'm
Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
As adult, amazing: back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! …Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating

But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain

Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things

When you kiss her in the kitchen
When you kiss her on the street
When you kiss her when she’s still asleep

It matters to her
It stays on her mind
When you put her first

When you think she don’t care
When you think she don’t notice

Every littlе look
Every single word
Oh it matters to hеr

When you pull her in close

When you shut up and listen
To what she has to say

Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go

You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there

Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend

Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat

Fuimos a la disco y los dos bailamos pegados
Como perros pegados, besos y un par de tragos

Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him

‘Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, ""That's right, fight's on, bitch!""
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

It's not up to me, we can only see

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage

Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it
My crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business

And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him

Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record

And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

I'm the only now that outdo me
I got hoes by the group tryna do me
My life like a movie, get head in the water
Don't gotta put in no work, I send orders
This shit done got serious, them millions come plural, I'm living by morals
We swipe 'em, ain't keepin', no Dora Explorer
I'm young and I'm turnt, I got bitches galore
My baby, my whip cost two-fifty, I'm splurgin'
Got five million cash just in case of emergency
My young niggas kill, get away, they be purgin'
It happened like this, I ain't do it on purpose
I'm working my move, nigga, which one of you workin'?
I turned on my crew, bought a coupe off of verses
I'm tired of these strippers, I'm going at nurses and doctors and dentists
You started, I finished, I told you we with it
My word is like gold to my city
I tell 'em to go, they gon' get it
I heard that you froze when they hit it
Putting these hoes in the business, you know that you tripping
I tell 'em no, they gon' listen

I sat down on a barstool, like a dern fool
'Cause she walked out again
Bartender said, ""I got you, yeah, 'cause I, too
Have been in your boots, my friend
Opened up back in '85
Got me over my first wife
Been stayin' busy since the first night""
It's a story old as time

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
God made the world in seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said, ""Please, Lord, if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms""
So God made a girl, His best work of art
Oh, but He didn't make no place to go when she breaks your hеart
So man made a bar

I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out, then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in Heaven, gets a little messy in Heaven

[Verse 1]
Barefoot on the pavement, he was never complacent
Held his ground for the town and the statement
Leader, never backs out of the arrangеment
Speaks out to the wholе crowd when he saves them
But he was the one that needed saving
Now he's low-key crushed on the inside
He gave his all and now he's breaking
You can see it in his eyes

[Chorus]
I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out, then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in Heaven, gets a little messy in Heaven

[Verse 2]
He's staying out on the weekdays, weekends
No sleep for the weak 'round here
Going out, getting lost in the deep end
White lines never dried no tears
He says no more, now he says no less
And the people wanna know where he goes next
Mind of a saint, so he knows best
But he don't sleep, nah, he don't rest
Turning water into wine, that's mad, that's mad
Everybody always wants what he has

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
[Chorus 1]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Chorus 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)402Embed",257

Nanti Kita Seperti Ini,Batas Senja,Nanti Kita Seperti Ini,69,"1 ContributorMalam Minggu Lyrics[Produced by Senartogok]

[Verse 1 : Rand Slam]
Semua bermula dari saat ku mulai
Tata rima dan urai makna hingga ku tuai
Sedikit hasil dan kasih, yang kasih sumbangsih
Ku fasih dan pasti nanti akan ku raih
Tiap cita dan cinta lewat tinta yakinkan
Bagai pita kaset jalan hidupku melingkar
Rekam jejakku saat masih di “Kata Pengantar”
Kini mengantarku ada di antara pelontar
Bertemu Bung Sutar, mahar rokok bungkusan
Nongkrong ke Tiben dan berbondong ketiban
Puluhan beat cantik untuk kami nikmati
Siap kami invasi dari bait ke bait
Dari hari ke hari ku tingkatkan intensitas
Perlihatkan atensi dalam tiap intensiku
Takkan berhenti tuk, belajar mengerti
Supaya ku seperti Doyz, terpandang di negeriku
Dan banyak energiku tuk balas mereka yang berjasa
Karena mereka yang pertama sempatkan waktu
Dengarkan
Sepatah kataku takkan mampu tuk ungkapkan
Biar senartogok ambil alih temani dia bernyanyi

[Hook : Senartogok]

Ini tembang kenangan untuk teman di sana
Kini tempat bertambah untuk tetap rekaman
Hendra jadi Alfabeta terus gali Alfabet
Tambah korbankan pikiran taruh Logika di Altar
Kau bisa lihat dari caraku melayang
Di setiap track di nada (Denada) “Kujelang Hari”
Dan kujelas cari, lukisan tiap tulisan
Hasil warisan insan suara “Barisan Nisan”
Ku akan jadikan rima sebagai detak dalam jejak
Hingga sisi kiri dada hanya tinggal Akapela
Kita semua banyak beda tetap satu dalam pena
Dan kopdar kemarin hanya bagian awal Pesta-
Literasi ranah ku dikenali awal ku dikedalikan musik
Hati
Selalu kunikmati kesempatan unjuk gigi
Terus belajar ke JuTa dia banyak kejutan
Selalu ada kedutan saat dengar flow Joe
Inginku membunuh maut kayak Senartogok
Makasih Bass Koplok, MG dimana berada
Ku syukuri tiap saat berkat berkat berkata ah…

[Verse 3 : Senartogok]
Saat Mic dikepal merontokkan gigi rutinitas
Aku Mike Tyson di tapal batas bosan menebas
Cemas, tersebar ganas ayat Khilafah
Lalu MC jadi Khalifa yang sedikit Mia
Bertelanjang rima, menikam gamang bulu Roma-
Bukanlah Gulag dimana, lirik bernasib Solzhenitsyn
Karena setiap larik telah dienkripsi tanpa mesin
Akulah The Cure yang jatuh cinta di hari (Jumat)
Mengganti solat, dengan 'Ziarah' Iwan Simatupang
""Untuk risiko dan eksperimen hidup
Sisanya spekulasi tuhan itu jalang""
Lalu (kamis) terlalu putih, pula (rabu) menggenap abu
Maka di (sela-sa)yup jiwa berdegup kematian menatap
Gugup
(Seni-n)ampak sopan seperti wasit di atas ring tinju
Dan estetika terlihat santun, bak pemadat di penjuru
Hasrat tak ubahnya kembar siam siap tumbuh
Pada tanah keinginan, antara pilu dan peluh
Musik memaksaku, jadi pendengar lalu angkat
Mikrofon
Buku mengajak pena mengisi nasib agar tak monoton
Melahap seminggu penuh, ketika imajinasi mulai kita
Rengkuh

[Hook 2x : Senartogok]

Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
'Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (Shit)
People just get sick 'cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment, I'm 'bout to blow
You'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom and the opponent is gettin' no
Mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood

You get no love

A dedication to all the refugees worldwide
One time

[Verse 1]
Say, say, say
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Brooklyn
Oba-observing the crookedness
As it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
And to my peeps who passed away

[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Oh, hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Say, say, say
I remember when we used to rock, oh
In a project yard in Jersey
And little Georgie would make the firelight
As stolen cars passed through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store
For Roots, paper, and brew
My drink's my only remedy
For pain of losing family
But while I'm gone, shorty

To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons

So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

Only God Can Judge Me (ft. Rappin' 4-Tay),2Pac,All Eyez On Me,69,"194 ContributorsOnly God Can Judge Me Lyrics[Intro: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me (That right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (Nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (Really)
Only God can judge me now

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use in tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Flatline
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up strangled, entangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Interlude: 2Pac]
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, ""You can fade him""
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise
[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them Buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm 'bout to floss some boss player shit with 4-Tay

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God

There's so much goin' on in this town
To keep me busy, I've been runnin' around
Up and down all these avenues
Doin' everything but thinkin' 'bout you
As long as I stay on 'em, I'm fine
The city side of those city limit signs
You don't really cross my mind

[Chorus]
But soon as I get out here on the outskirts
I wish I was runnin' by your house first
Somethin' 'bout a summer in the south sure
Shines like gold down these old
Round bail, river valley back roads
Way back in the holler where the grass grows
God almighty, baby, we were that close
To ditchin' this town and settlin' down
Out here on the outskirts

[Verse 2]
If I'da had a lick of damn sense
I'd be on the greener side of that fence
Little starter house we've finally outgrown
Twelve-hundred feet we're 'bout to add on
Smilin' out there watchin' them
Big ol' yellow buckets 'bout to break ground

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love

[Pre-Chorus]
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

[Chorus]
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away

The year has just started and right now, I'm lookin' for cribs overseas

When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside, now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille, a crib by the port and it's imported

And I know that nigga get money now, I am the nigga that taught him

[Verse 1: Young Adz]
Bro, I get the birds in, fuck a drought
Worker is misbehavin', chuck him out
I get the money, money from her house
Out in a lovely, lovely country town
I said, if you care about her, fly her out
Go to the Louis store and buy it now
I'ma keep pourin' 'til I'm runnin' out
I just hit it from the back, she scared, she runnin' out
Ooh, young and lit, money keep on comin' in
Ooh, I keep a rock band on standby, pull up and drum that shit
Ooh, deep in it, I'ma swim, hand on heart, I love this chick
Ooh, all them niggas 'round me family, love them on some brother shit

[Verse 2: Central Cee]
She suck my soul, she done it like Ash Kaash, I keep on gettin' them flashbacks
I was OT so I had to bash, I almost thought about gettin' a cab back
Do it like Rico and video that, if we upload it,  it'll probably get some backlash
Backshots, she got the ripple effect, it's too temptin' and I can't help but slap that
Fuck that, pull out, I don't wanna be a dad yet
Plan B, girl, you gotta swallow that tablet
The way that she handle it, this one talented
Pum-pum soakin', feel like I'm paddlin'
Back come 'round, I'm a fan of it
Ride on a bike one time and saddle it (Oh)
Ayo, her doctor workin' wonders
Damn, that's a big circumference (Oh)
Get her wet, she don't need no lube
On the fortieth floor, you should see the views (Alright)
She don't wanna send me her pussy on Snapchat, madman, I don't wanna leak your nudes
How do I say it without seemin' rude? (Huh)
I just wanna see if it's cute
Shake that back like a video vixen
This one here don't wanna be in my tunes
She wanna go Nobu just for the Snap
If I pay for the tab, you best eat your food
Word on the road is Cench get a hunnid a show
This ho' wan' see if it's true
Posh ting, she don't wanna be with the squares no more, she said she wanna be with the goons

Las sábanas blancas donde te escondías dentro

Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo
Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto

Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejará

Solo un beso y tú te vas

Real Back In Style,Potter Payper,Real Back In Style,61,"5 ContributorsReal Back In Style Lyrics[Verse]
You ain't gotta be the richest, just be the realest
My acclaim's critical, but I'm a fuckin' cynic
You're a fuckin' gimmick, mimic
Do it all for the image, but never really did it
I can't rest, I'm too wicked, I feel my mood switchin'
I ain't never gave nobody a problem who didn't want it
All you had to do was show me and I went and got it
There's an elephant in the room, but I'm sittin' on it
I got mental scars from this shit, but we're livin' off it
When they bring the streets up, I think you should switch the topic
If I'm bein' real, I don't mind, we can split the profit
I wake up and bill a rocket, last year, I saw my first M
This year, I need a couple profit, I got no timе to sit and gossip
And that's word to the trap I kicked in for the things I wantеd
Ambition like mine, let me know when you come across it
They'll probably come across it and then double-cross it
Make all of them mistakes and then learn nothin' from it
It hits a little different when you're comin' from it
The struggle, that's what made you, why you runnin' from it?
I been a real dope boy, you can't beat my grind
Can't break my spirit, in the shade, I shine
You need guns when you're mixed up in beef like mine
It's hard not to smile when you got some teeth like mine
Nanny told me, ""Don't go out there, boy, it's cold outside""
I question everything I stood for and rode my time
Time and time again, one of me and there's five of them
I bring my knees to my chest and I rise again
I don't care who I might offend
If you ain't love me in the first place, why pretend?
If I sit and think about all the nights I spent on some heartbroke shit
'Cah my body gave up, but my heart won't quit
I bought fourteen grams, but my half won't flip
I got laces and boots, goals and assists
Fifty jailhouse fades, on Neighbourhood Crip
I really live this shit, you're a rappin'-ass bitch
I lost so many mates, I rub shoulders with greats
On these council estate
Tenth floor in the stairs, we used to hide from the rain
Fell in love with the life just to hide from the shade
Still shine in the shade
Kill the ego, maintain, humble, I remain
Still, I go against the grain
Real back in style, let them hate 'cause they know we are what they ain't
I wanna tell you that I'm strugglin', but I can't find the words
I wanna stay with you forever, but I need some millions first
I know that seems surprising 'cause I been a trillionaire
Blue plates and plastic bowls, I don't come from silverware
Don't get yourself killed in here
Before I sleep, I say a prayer
They got bags of energy, but nothin' to declare
This life, it left me broke, I just need someone to repair
I watched him take a lift and kept on runnin' up the stairs
I can leave the streets and just rap, I got shares
I'm too busy gettin' mine to think about yours
You can ask Theo, he was tickin' me drawers
I won't talk about the people who was givin' me squares, I ain't forgettin'
Pissed down the block, screws put me on default
They let me out for dinner and I jumped on the nettin'
I'm more rejoicin' than regrettin'
'Cah if they never kicked my head in and stripped me naked and took my beddin'
If I never climbed out all the holes I fell in
If I never had scraps, I didn't know the swellin'
If I never sold smack, I didn't know what Hell is
Then it's freedom itself, I wouldn't know the blessin'
Then they wouldn't be callin' me the hope and message
Now we're copacetic, can we toast a beverage?

See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?

Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?

I remember the sickness was forever
I remember snuff videos
Cold Septembers, the distances we covered
The fist fights on the beach
The Bizzies round us up
Do it all again next week
An embryonic love
The first time that it scarred
Embarrass yourself for someone
Cryin' like a child
And the boy who kicked Tom's head in
Still bugs me now
That's the thing, it lingers
And claws you when you're down

[Verse 2]
I was far too scared to hit him
But I would hit him in a heartbeat now
That's the thing with anger, it begs to stick around
So it can fleece you of your beauty
And leave you spent with nowt to offer
Makes you hurt the ones who love you

And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead

Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

Hope you ain't lovin' the crew

Pray it ain't more than a few
Know that you dealt with some lames

He had to pop your cherry
But I got it wet like a pool
She got a new G-Wag'
She wanna hit Highlight Room and show it off
Got a new body, girl, show it off
This a Brazilian, I know it's soft
Toned up and she got a six-pack
Look like she used to play volleyball
American Express, you can have it all
Code to the safe, you can have it all
Fuck your main pagе, what's your Finsta? I wanna know the real you
You started dancin' to pay your tuition, girl, I wanna know what you been through
You want a boutiquе or you wanna sell hair, just let me know what you into

They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah

Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue

One call, I'm sittin' front row
One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
One call and my niggas ten toes

Even if we gotta travel 'cross the globe
Down to take you to the end of the road, for real

His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive

Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]
[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

Command me to be well

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

Take me to church

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news
Don't you tell Daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay

It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day
I've never felt this way

He opens the door and he don't make me cry

In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens, but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights

Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

[Post-Chorus]
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote (Yeah)
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin'
That I’m sewin' up the game, destroyin' life, they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat, and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned (Bah)
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stop
I just laugh at nigga wishin' they were this hot (Haha)
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind

But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed–wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller when I won't buy a soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up, I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 3: T.I.]
The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with (That's it!)
But don’t get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (Nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (Bitch), but she know I’m rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Peso, euro, yen, ah-ha, I’m paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can't get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish—sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now, but in case you didn't
I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So, I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it, double timin' it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say ""K-Mart's"" like there's an apostrophe ""s"" on it, dog
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg!
[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as they king, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

[Chorus: T.I., Eminem, Both]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

The Nights,Avicii,The Nights,24,"93 ContributorsThe Nights Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Hey) Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
""When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

[Chorus]
He said, ""One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember""
My father told me when I was just a child
""These are the nights that never die""

Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said, ""Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are""

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""

The Real Slim Shady,Eminem,The Marshall Mathers LP,89,"459 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsPolskiItalianoDeutschFrançaisThe Real Slim Shady Lyrics[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah
[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date"" — ""Looks like an olive to me""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press

...Man, whatever

Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo
[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (You ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? (Parents at?) And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be Black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am

On stage turning dudes to a mockery
Yeah they copy me with no cash

Loading up the nine, dope stay a dime
Two blunts in the Watson 749
Red wine avocado, salad with the lamb and
Cilantro head honcho, rocking a poncho
Way out in Mexico
10 for the bird let you place the decimal
Turn your ass vegetable

You the next nigga, well, I'm the X nigga
Name still ringing bells so fuck the rest nigga
I do this shit for real, y'all niggas is acting
I'm old school like Andre the giant and Bob Backlund
Cats ain't never been able to ever
Fuck with the dog, whatever the weather
I come through, niggas bow down like Muslims praying
I'm just trying to understand what these fools are saying
Don't make me, somebody better take me outta here
This is what it came down to, fuck outta here
Cats gotta fear a nigga like me
I come through in beast mode from New York to AZ
Bitch you fucking crazy, thinking Dog ain't got it
Dog gon' hit it, as soon as soon as dog spot it
I'ma scratch to the death, till there's half of 'em left
I'm the last of 'em left, till the last of my breath

When you had everybody locked in and talkin', nigga
That's the feelin' that I need

[Verse]
Uh
I just put, I just put a tonne on the back of a truck (Uh)
Me and Midgy should’ve won the Cannabis Cup
I ain’t put no plaques on my wall yet
By at least five, I’ll send those packs to your doorstep
In this, in this music scene I’m legendary
Raps always been secondary like February
Told my guy, “Don’t come near me with no tester” (Uh)
Don’t be talkin’ packs ‘round Siri and Alexa
Free the gang, I can't forget my celly
I was gettin' letters in the can, like alphabets spaghetti, uh
All these niggas bite my style
I did ""A-Wings Got Talent"" in jail, I was like Simon Cowell
I was in cali 'round the neck like bow tie
K-K-Kush God, bitch, I'm the most high
I see these rappers actin' Holly' (Uh)
When they were out there crowd surfing, we were catchin' bodies (Who were they?)
I ain't a tough guy, I always make everybody laugh
I could spit all my bars wearin' a polygraph
Rap star, still makin' pounds fly
Opps tryna' turn me stray like Ivory from How High
Used to shot ounces
Had a sold out tour, but I still got more fans in my crop houses
I spray up where you're cotchin'
Spent all my money on packs, I was literally weighing up my options
They say their guns spit, they ain't never done shit
Just landed the runtz 'bout to roll up a trumpet, uh
She want a man with P, but that bitch poor
That's why I'm in her crib hiding keys like a jigsaw
Still got food on the curb
I pull up with this half moon, I don't mean do not disturb
Came alone, could've brought an army
If I air it out, forensics will have to pick up more men than Lori Harvey
Came a long way from trappin' in the rain
My chicks a side bitch 'cause I'm married to the game, uh
Me and Budz in Dubai on a jetski
Sold so much coke like I'm rivals with Pepsi
I used to break these packs down into fractions
These niggas do way too much capping in their captions
I'm tryna leave the game but I need a lane (Uh)
These niggas pree the chain, they don't see the pain
They sent me jail for importing weed from Spain
I came home, in six weeks released a strain
Still remember reloading on a Q
We got them jungle boys, it ain't Mowgli and Baloo
The CM wishing they could bring me back
Cah they still need gangsters like me to point their fingers at, uh
Last year I was missing rap
I was on the wing kicking back with my nigga Skrapz
Even though my block's full of pricks, I ain't (Nah)
And I don't trust bitches even if my chick's a saint
Paid for my last campaign, label ain't reimbursed me
Smashed her and never picked up cah she was thirsty
They just started, I was shipping packs time ago
Trading flavours with all the growers outside my show, uh
This ain't happened cause of luck
Fuck your little chain, I spend that shit at Hakkasan on duck
To make it to a kilo, that was the game plan
When I had no 'nect like I was playing Rayman
Used to have a thirty-eight when I was trapping in the snow
Still got it to this day, I even brang it to my show, uh
I can move a hundred keys in less than a week
Driving through the other side like this is Sesame Street (Pussies)
Still the same old me even though I'm rich
And it's still gang gang, I'll never switch

Si supieras que te escribí
No he mandado los mensajes, siguen todos ahí
Wow, qué mucho me ha costa'o
Quizás te hice un favor cuando me fui de tu lado

Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can, Ken, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But, Lindsay, please come back to seeing men

Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim

Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
""Lord, help us, he's back in his pink ALF shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak

Fuck, you can't even sing

Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

[Verse 2]
Well, life is (Too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served

What Is Real?,The Band That Saved The World,Name in Lights,33,"1 ContributorThe Celluloid Road Lyrics[I. The American Watchworld]

I go there nearly every night, I find the accents so familiar...
If I heard one here in town, I'd spin myself around
To see who was talking like they were on TV
From America!

Steam rises from pavements in this strange world
Of fire escapes and trash cans
Muted brass sets the tone of the scene
And though the backdrop's not that clean
There's always someone on hand to sort it out - in America

Bruce Willis has the airport locked down and
Hollywood superstars are running the town
Peter Parker writes it all in the free press
(While his editor puts him under serious duress)
And if I ate Italian, well I might be scared
That some kind of gunfight would break out down the stairs
Jack Bauer's 'gone dark' and there's an APB
It's a hell of a job defending the Land Of The Free

But it looks alright! In the TV light
America, is that you?
Or did we get it right?
You might also likeI know your monuments by heart
Climbed down Mount Rushmore in the moonlight
(I've never been to Dakota though
I just dropped in for the show
Bought my North By Northwest poster - at HMV)

And so I guess I'd be nervous waiting for a Greyhound Bus
Although the people around me might not see the fuss
But maybe if a crop duster was doing the nearby fields
They'd be running just like me?
And if I met some end in a backstreet night
The cops'd have the coffee and donuts ready by first light
And maybe if I was lucky I'd get Sandra Bullock on the case
Any my Greyhound Bus would get me any place!

[II. Cops & Boxes]

America, did we get it right?
Or is what I see from the chair in my room
Some kind of illusion through the Yorkshire gloom
Oh America, do we see it right?
Oh you've got people swinging from buildings
(And a bomb's just about to go off, one man armies on every street corner - so I wouldn't worry, that guy in the deli is probably some kind of ex-marine)
Hey will you save me from the End Of The World
From the curse of the Bad Guys, 'cos that's what I heard
Oh America, do we see you right?
[III. On The Road Again]

Let's take the Freeway, try to lose the town
Let's eat some distance, see what's goin' down
I'll be Dennis Hopper, you be Thelma (or Louise)
We'll kick up dust as the sun strobes through the trees
And we'll have ourselves a real Easy Ride

A Motel hoarding looms out of the dust
Abandoned steelworks glowing with rust
Watching all those telegraph wires
Follow the eternal yellow line

We're on the Road again!
We're on the Road

And I'm half hoping that some guy in a truck
Is gonna chase me through the landscape (be just my luck)
I wanna stop at diners where they spit on the floor
And give you long, cold looks when you walk through the door

Rivers getting deeper, mountains getting high
Roads are getting smaller 'neath the bigger, bluer sky
Bridges made of matchwood in a country made of iron
And ""Jesus Saves"" - if you believe the signs
Fin-tailed Caddies and thick milk shakes
Dunkin' Donuts and screeching brakes
Tarantino makes it all live again
(With a 'Motherfucker' dropped in, every now and then)
We're on the road.....

[IV. The Inner Heart]

And far from the Freeway
Where we find your inner heart
Of Cowboys and Cacti, Meth Labs and Mountains
Holes in the desert with the bodies of gangsters
Or Indians from the movies...

Rattlesnakes
And Salt Lakes
All here
All true
Under the unrelenting sun
And deep underground
They're at Def Con One

[V. San Francisco]

I've seen this town in ruins, its bridges broken twice
I've seen it take an earthquake, bombarded by ice
Attacked by giant lizards and levelled to the ground
I've seen it in the future when there's no-one around
But you can still buy a pizza

And half the region's folklore comes from the city jails
Whether it's Clint or Johnny Cash, the underdog prevails
I've walked the Wharf with James Bond, seen Gandalf lift the bridge
I was safely in England when the aliens made their pitch

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

The future home of Starfleet, the LAST home of the whales
(A Bird of Prey still rusting beneath your silver waves)
Skyscraper infernoes, militia on The Rock
Volkswagens that drive themselves
And apes that freely talk

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

[spoken]
Who's the band that gets all the chicks?
The Tangent!
You're damn right!

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

The Tangent!

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!
Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

America, did we get it right?
San Francisco, San Francisco
America, did we get it right?
Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

But I'm just eavesdropping on an LED screen
From the centre of England, can I believe what I've seen?
Will I ever walk those streets again?

[VI. The American Watchworld (Reprise)]

America, my love affair goes on
That faith in flag and proud salute still touch me
As in your world of men, you save the President again
And have your troops back home in time for the parade

Once again, tears fill my eyes
As the future hero drops his first catch
But the montage you make will show him
Gain wisdom as he grows
And we all wish we could grow up like him

What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then, I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' they nonviolent, talkin' like they— (Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from Riddick (Yeah)
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid—never come down!
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold your breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!
[Chorus: Phish]

A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back (Right), just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: ""Whose throat is it?""
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*Beep-beep!*)
Raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
That's for tryna talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
And you better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I just don't give a fuck!"" and see who means it

A song will write you, you don't write it
I, didn't mean to fall in love
Was rhythm that created us
I was running, we collided

[Pre-Chorus]
Baseline, I will always make time
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me
Baseline, after all the great times
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart

[Chorus]
When the beat drops out
And the people gone
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the lights go out and the morning come
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the beat drops out
And the people gone
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the lights go out and the morning come
Will you still be there, still be there for me child

White America,Eminem,The Eminem Show,69,"250 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeItalianoहिन्दीWhite America Lyrics[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on

White America! Erica loves my shit

[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) — Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—
[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot"", shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—
[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Outro]
So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!

White ash on my hotel floor room
Feds still watchin', hopin' they get bored soon
I'm bored of the fame, but that's my good fortune
I keep losin' all my friends and that subject's sore too
Never switch on me, I know I can't force you
I can't trust you, how could I endorse you?
I just hope you run with everything I taught you
I said I just hope you run with everything I taught you
I got white ash on these custom seats and I'm custer-free
Not talkin' in the car, they probably bugged the veecs
Go and hug your kids about you hug the streets
I don't smoke pagans, I smoke ganja leaf
I got guns for beef and leave sons deceasеd
He's always talkin' the most, but he doеs the least
We go kway back, I known him since dungarees
Probably hate me 'cause I know you never done the greaze
'Magine if we went school, we could've done degrees
'Stead we was sellin' crack, bitch, run the P's
Now I'm a rap star, they think I fund the streets
I got white ash on my kitchen counter
Smoke in my eye while I sit and count
I keep thinkin' 'bout yesterday's encounter
I know they're schemin' on me, I'ma lick him down
I seen man run for his life and get disembowelled
And his friends don't ride, they just miss him now
And he raps and they all wanna diss him now
Either that or they're all arse-lickin' now
I got white ash in the boardroom
I'm rappin' with execs, they're actin' all cordial
You're an informer and they treat me informal
My kids are adorable
I'm head of the family, I make it affordable
I'm killin' the rap game and holdin' memorials
Subscribe to my YouTube, I'm givin' tutorials
I rose from the crack smoke, that's different euphorias
White ash in his pipe, Frank White, I'm notorious
I was kippin' in Gloria's
Paid three for the rent, steady livin' inglorious
They ain't tryna do it, not unless there's an audience
Not a leg to stand on, he's still shootin', he think he's Oscar Pistorius
White ash on my booth floor, I don't need a chorus
They'll have you stuck in time and the jails are Victorian
My licence just done and I'm feelin' victorious
I'm curvin' all these bitches, they ain't got no decorum
I got white ash on my hotel floor room
Feds still watchin', hopin' they get bored soon
I'm bored of the fame, but that's my good fortune
I keep losin' all my friends and that subject's sore too

Without Me,Eminem,The Eminem Show,90,"439 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolTürkçePortuguês日本語Italianoहिन्दीDeutschFrançaisفارسیDanskWithout Me Lyrics[Intro: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks *record scratch*

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
(Woo!) (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back? Back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me, so
Come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits, and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!
You might also like[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?
[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K
HK 'til your chest plate cave
I'ma ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I'll survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad have called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa Queens, mixed in with Ca$his creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G?
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?
See…

I hear the clock, it's six A.M
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots up off the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause

Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie and it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad 'cause

Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line?
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, every day

[Verse 3]
I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and I turn the sheets down
And take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
I shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause...

Since I've seen that lettin' down your hair
Double-dog-dare look in your eyes
Oh, and you've been burnin' it at both hands
Been a hot minute since you flipped that switch
Girl, it ain't nobody's fault, shut the world off
And turn it back to when

Sinkin' to the bottom of them country songs
Fire burnin' hot 'til the last drop's gone

And say them things that stay in the dark
Ain't nothin' as sweet, ain't nothin' as strong
As you, me, and whiskey all night long

Girl, you ain't missed a beat
You already let a little four lettеr slip
And your hands are all over me

It's a little bit funny
This feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 3]

Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross

And filmed me on the bonnet

And pulled my sleeves around my heart

遊びに行くならどこに行くの？
何も食べてない
それは内緒
何を聞かれても
のらりくらり

だけど燦々と
見えそうで見えない秘密は蜜の味
あれもないないない

相手は？

完璧じゃない君じゃ許せない

知りたくないとこは見せずに
唯一無二じゃなくちゃイヤイヤ
それこそ本物のアイ

[Bridge]
得意の笑顔で沸かすメディア
隠しきるこの秘密だけは

これこそ私なりの愛だ
流れる汗も綺麗なアクア
ルビーを隠したこの瞼
歌い踊り舞う私はマリア
そう嘘はとびきりの愛だ

[Pre-Chorus]
誰かに愛されたことも
誰かのこと愛したこともない
そんな私の嘘がいつか本当になること
信じてる

いつかきっと全部手に入れる

等身大でみんなのこと
ちゃんと愛したいから
今日も嘘をつくの
この言葉がいつか本当になる日を願って
それでもまだ
君と君にだけは言えずにいたけど

あぁ、やっと言えた
これは絶対嘘じゃない
